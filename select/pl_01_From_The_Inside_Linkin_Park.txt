I don’t know who to trust
No surprise
Everyone feels
So far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust
And the lies
Trying not to break
But I’m so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how
Trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me
Take everything
From the inside
And throw it all away
‘Cause I swear
For the last time
I won’t trust myself with you
Tension is building inside
Steadily
Everyone feels
So far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way
Out of me
Trying not to break
But I’m so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how
Trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me
Take everything
From the inside
And throw it all away
‘Cause I swear
For the last time
I won’t trust myself with you
I won’t waste myself on you
You
You
Waste myself on you
You
You
I take everything
From the inside
And throw it all away
‘Cause I swear
For the last time
I won’t trust myself with you
Everything
From the inside
And just throw it all away
‘Cause I swear
For the last time
I won’t trust myself with you
You
You
