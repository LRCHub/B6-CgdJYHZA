[00:51.72] You, with your fast and fur lined mind
[01:10.76] With your disregard of time, virtue, horizon
[01:18.02] Here where the angels never sleep
[01:23.45] Where the water's dark and deep, you breathe molasses
[01:49.95] 
[01:30.70] Midnight from the inside out
[01:34.33] Turn around and they all fall down
[01:37.05] Screaming red and the lights go out
[01:39.77] Turn around and they all fall down
[01:56.77] 
[01:43.46] Midnight from the inside out
[01:46.19] Turn around and they all fall down
[01:49.81] Screaming red and the lights go out
[01:52.54] Turn around and they all fall down
[02:09.54] 
[02:09.36] You, madness dripping from your tongue
[02:14.80] While starting at the sun, you speak explosion
[02:22.07] Up, with the flies around the moon
[02:27.51] With a needle, mirror, spoon and cotton candy
[02:50.01] 
[02:34.88] Midnight from the inside out
[02:38.53] Turn around and they all fall down
[02:41.25] Screaming red and the lights go out
[02:44.87] Turn around and they all fall down
[03:01.87] 
[02:47.60] Midnight from the inside out
[02:51.23] Turn around and they all fall down
[02:53.95] Screaming red and the lights go out
[02:57.57] Turn around and they all fall down
[03:00.29] [Incomprehensible]
[03:09.29] 
[03:38.50] Midnight from the inside out
[03:41.23] Turn around and they all fall down
[03:43.95] Screaming red and the lights go out
[03:47.72] Turn around and they all fall down
[04:04.72] 
[03:50.44] Midnight from the inside out
[03:54.07] Turn around and they all fall down
[03:56.78] Screaming red and the lights go out
[04:00.41] Turn around and they all fall down
[04:17.41] 
[04:03.13] Turn around and they all fall down
[04:05.84] Turn around and they all fall down
[04:09.47] Turn around and they fall
